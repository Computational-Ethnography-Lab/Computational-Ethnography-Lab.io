## What is Computational Ethnography?

Computational ethnography s a methodological approach that combines qualitative methods with computational social science (CSS). This involves analyzing ethnographic or qualitative data—field observations, in-depth interviews, and textual records—through both human interpretation and CSS tools for pattern analysis and visualization. This approach preserves ethnography's strengths at examining behavior and meaning in real-world contexts, while using natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and text visualization to help represent systematic patterns, test emerging typologies, and analyze larger datasets than would otherwise be possible. The method centers on human control over analytical decisions and scaling insights to advance empirical understanding, even when using automation (e.g., to help index or curate data).

Key practices include pairing structured representations of patterns (e.g., heatmaps, network plots) with in-depth narratives of behavior, using reproducible analysis pipelines, and transparent procedures that support verification. These tools were developed for broadly realist inquiry in social science and health policy, but have been used across other epistemological approaches. As a core commitment, computational ethnography extends rather than replaces human reasoning by enabling systematic analysis of larger corpora than might be feasible without computation, while preserving the contextual depth that distinguishes ethnographic work from purely computational or quantitative text analysis, addressing analytical needs between 'big data' and small-n analysis. (c.f. Abramson et al. 2018, 2026).

## The Computational Ethnography Lab (CEL)

The Computational Ethnography Lab is an interdisciplinary group developing and applying computational tools to analyze qualitative data. While affiliated scholars pursue diverse topics, our work concentrates on social inequality, health, institutions, networks, and culture. Our core commitments include building community, practicing methodological transparency, and advancing social science knowledge that serves broader public benefit.
