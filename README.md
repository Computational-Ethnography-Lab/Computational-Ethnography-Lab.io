# About the Lab & Our Approach

## What is Computational Ethnography?

Computational ethnography is a methodological approach that combines in-depth analysis of text data produced in research—such as ethnographic field notes, interview transcripts, historical documents, or web posts—with tools for pattern analysis and visualization. This approach maintains a focus on situating meaning and behavior in real-world contexts, while integrating tools from computational social science (CSS). Natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and various types of data visualization help represent patterns, test emerging typologies, facilitate comparison, and analyze individual and team-based datasets alongside in-depth human reading.

A core principle is connecting levels of analysis—much like alternating between digital maps and street views—to gain a broader vantage that may be obscured by either the scope (computational) or granularity (qualitative) of a single mode of inquiry. In this sense, computational ethnography extends classic sociological concerns with using multiple methods, data types, and forms of analysis to better understand topics of interest (Du Bois 1899, 1900; Small 2011).

As a core commitment, computational ethnography extends rather than replaces human reasoning by linking aggregate patterns with contextual details, and by enabling the analysis of larger volumes of text than would be feasible without computation. The goal is not to remove but to add to the contextual depth that distinguishes ethnographic work, while enhancing the capacity to answer new questions or revisit old ones in new ways (c.f. Abramson et al. 2018, 2025). This goal parallels emergent scholarship at the intersection of scaling up field methods and connecting “big data” to in-depth content (Abramson and Dohan 2015; Breiger 2015; Hanson and Theis 2024; Nelson 2020; DiMaggio, Nag, and Blei 2013).

## The Computational Ethnography Lab (CEL)

The Computational Ethnography Lab is an interdisciplinary group developing and applying computational tools to analyze qualitative data. While affiliated scholars pursue diverse topics, our work concentrates on social inequality, health, institutions, networks, and culture. Our core commitments include building community, practicing methodological transparency, and advancing social science knowledge that serves broader public benefit.
