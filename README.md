# The Computational Ethnography Lab @ Rice University

*Deploying and developing cutting-edge methodological techniques at the intersection of field research and computational social science to address complex problems of scientific and policy importance.*

## What is Computational Ethnography?

Computational ethnography integrates computational techniques with the analysis of in-depth human data such as field observations and interviews. This hybrid method combines ethnography’s focus on meaning, context, and lived behavior with tools like natural language processing, machine learning, and visualization to support larger samples, identify patterns, validate typologies, and increase reproducibility. These tools extend rather than replace ethnographic interpretation and can benefit projects across scientific and applied contexts when used transparently (Abramson & Dohan 2015; Abramson et al. 2018).

## The Computational Ethnography Lab (CEL)

The Computational Ethnography Lab is an interdisciplinary collective that develops and applies computational tools to analyze qualitative data. While affiliated scholars pursue a range of topics, our current work emphasizes social inequality, health, institutions, networks, and culture. Our shared values include fostering community, practicing transparency, and advancing social science in ways that generate broader public benefit.
