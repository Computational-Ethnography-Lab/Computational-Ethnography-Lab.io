# The Computational Ethnography Lab @ Rice University

*Deploying and developing cutting-edge methodological techniques at the intersection of field research and computational social science to address complex problems of scientific and policy importance.*

## What is Computational Ethnography?

Computational ethnography combines computational techniques with ethnographic or qualitative data—field observations, in-depth interviews, and textual records. This approach preserves ethnography's strengths at examining behavior and meaning in real-world contexts, while using natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and visualization tools to help represent systematic patterns, test emerging typologies, and analyze larger datasets than would otherwise be possible. The method centers on human control over analytical decisions and theoretical development, even when using automation (e.g., to help index or curate data).

Key practices include pairing structured representations of patterns (e.g., heatmaps, network plots) with in-depth narratives, using reproducible analysis pipelines, and transparent procedures that support verification. These tools were developed for broadly realist inquiry in social science and health policy, but prove useful across varied epistemological approaches. As a core commitment, computational ethnography extends rather than replaces human reasoning by enabling systematic analysis of larger corpora while preserving the contextual depth that distinguishes ethnographic work from purely computational or quantitative text.

## The Computational Ethnography Lab (CEL)

The Computational Ethnography Lab is an interdisciplinary collective developing and applying computational tools to analyze qualitative data. While affiliated scholars pursue diverse topics, our work concentrates on social inequality, health, institutions, networks, and culture. Our core commitments include building community, practicing methodological transparency, and advancing social science knowledge that serves broader public benefit.
